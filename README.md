### About SunFounder Multi-Control:
The SunFounder Multi Control is a multiple control board based on ATmega32U4. With the mini USB port, you can connect it to the PC or Raspberrry Pi to use.
It can be used to simulate gamepad handle, midi device, and PC keyboard.
In the gamepad mode, the button layout is almost the same with a gamepad, so it is quite suitable for RetroPie games.
In the midi mode, just connect GND to you with the alligator clip cable, and other holes to some conductive objects. Then it can realize the midi input when you touch the conductive objects.
In the PC keyboard mode, all the connected conductive objects are mapped to some keys, which you can customize yourself.
